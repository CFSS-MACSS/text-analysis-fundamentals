# example from Emily Dickinson
text <- c("Because I could not stop for Death -",
          "He kindly stopped for me -",
          "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -",
          "and Immortality")
text

# to turn this text into tidy text data, first we put it into a data frame (tibble here)
text_df <- tibble(line = 1:4, text = text)
text_df

# not quite done, We canâ€™t filter out words or count which occur most frequently, 
# since each row is made up of multiple combined words. 
# We need to convert this so that it has one-token-per-document-per-row
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
